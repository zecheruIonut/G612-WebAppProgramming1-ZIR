                    The game now also provides a full-size version of the game, with an "app store" included for a huge assortment of titles: Steam, GOG, The Sims, Angry Birds, and many others. The free version also has it's own Steam and GOG store. It also included a nice full-size PDF that I made to help keep it organized.
                    As with other Steam add-ons, the game also comes bundled with the "I'm an English Game Nerd" bonus feature, which will let you use the game in most other languages, or on any computer or Mac, as long as it's the only English language game.
                    One major difference between other online add-ons and the Steam add-on bundle is no longer getting an online game. With add-ons they will still have to download something. This works quite well on all platforms, including PC. Also, there is no better option: now you'd have to download a download in the background. (And don't forget to save your game before playing.)
